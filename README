CGI::Form2XML README
====================

CGI::Form2XML is designed to render the parameters of a CGI Request as an
XML document in a similar way to CGI::XML or CGI::XMLForm, however it does
so to a fixed schema (which is included with the distribution).  It was
defined for a particular application and was released in the hope that it
might prove useful for someone else.  However if more flexibility is
required in the contruction of the XML you probably want to look at one
of the other modules described.

The original intent of this module was to pass the results of a form
submission to a Message Oriented Middleware application and thence to a
processing application (or applications) in order to be able to capture
data on a web site in a loosely coupled manner.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires that the CGI module is present - however as this
has been part of the standard distribution since 5.004.04 I don't think
this is a problem.
